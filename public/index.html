    <p>At the end of 2020, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from Syracuse University. I had the
      opportunity to take classes that spanned a wide range of Computer Science topics.
      The classes that interested me the most contained extensive back end work. <b>Software Modeling</b> tasked me with
      developing on the .NET Framework and creating a remote repository using WCF and WPF.
      <b>Software Engineering</b> offered the opportunity to design and build any type of application that followed the
      SDLC life cycle and Agile Methodology.
      With this, my group and I created an application to search Amazon for in-stock Nintendo Switch consoles and post
      them to a local website. <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> also gave me the opportunity to create more robust
      applications
      and nailed down coding best practices, whether it be code commenting, version control, or any object oriented
      programming principals. <b>Mobile Application Programming</b> tasked me with building my own Android mobile
      application that interfaced with a
      live Firebase instance and utilized RESTful APIs. I decided to build an application I name OnRn that allowed users
      to share whatever song they were currently playing and have it pin to their current location on a live updating map.
      The idea in mind was that users would be able to see what music was "On Right Now"
      anywhere in the world.

    <p>In 2017, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with a concentration in Actuarial Science and a
      minor in Information Technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
      The coursework involved a mix of theoretical and practical topics ranging from <b>Mathematical Finance</b> to
      <b>Statistical Computing</b> to <b>Regression Analysis</b>. I also was a founding father for the university's
      Insurance, Risk Management and Actuarial Science fraternity, Gamma Iota Sigma. Acting as the Director of Information
      Management Systems,
      I was tasked with creating a responsive website that allowed current and potential members to learn more about the
      group, and access any resources provided to the group from the Gamma Iota Sigma headquarters.
      Although basic for the most part, the main components of the site were easily accessible to anyone that utilized the
      site.
      <br>These courses laid the groundwork for me to want to further learn and pursue my main interests in Computer
      Science, leading me to return to academia two years later to start and complete my Master's degree.</p>

  <b><u>Personal Webite (You Are Here!)</u></b>
  <br>Personal Website built to work on both front end and back end development. Built using Node.js and PostgreSQL, and deployed to Heroku. Endpoints created using Express.JS. Heroku Scheduler is used to update Premier League and F1 Standings. 
  Both sets of standings are updated once an hour and sent to their respective PostgreSQL tables (provided by Heroku) to limit the amount of calls to their API. On site load, standings tables are updated to the most recent PostgreSQL tables to create a "live" hourly 
  standings update. 
  <br><br>
  <b><u>Switch Stock</u></b>
  <br>Web-based application built with Python in order to identify Nintendo Switch consoles in stock at Amazon and
  output information through a user-interface. Built on a team, the Switch Stock application utilized GitLab for version
  control and collaboration. The Amazon API was utilized to obtain product information that was sent to a Firebase
  database in which the user interface pulls the most recent data from and outputs the current product stock to the
  user.
  <br><br>
  <b><u>Spike</u></b>
  <br>Web-based personal project built with Python and the Dash library with the goal of creating a live visualization
  of current users on specific subreddits on Reddit.com. The application displays multiple graphs of user-submitted
  subreddits where data points are obtained from the Reddit API and are updated on an interval and displayed on a live
  graph. The goal in mind was to monitor active users and find “spikes” in user presence, implying something of note
  occurring on the subreddit, encouraging users of the application to see why there is a large increase of active users.
  <br><br>
  <b><u>Building and Floor Access</u></b>
  <br>Programmed in C++. Using Object Oriented Programming with inheritance and polymorphism, created an application
  that allows users to create a building structure that can add occupants and companies to the building. Users can add
  employees to existing companies to create a directory of the building. Other occupants include guests and building
  employees.
  <br><br>
  <b><u>Remote Documentation Generator</u></b>
  <br>Programmed in C#. Part of a semester long project, users are asked to input a series of C# files where the
  documentation generator would create linked HTML web pages of the code where users could interact with the web page
  expanding and collapsing code based on scope. This generator was then used with WCF in order to host these generated
  pages where users could edit, access, or download files after logging in or creating an account.
